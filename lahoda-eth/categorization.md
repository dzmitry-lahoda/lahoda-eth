# Overview

Integrative writing for internet.

## Overlaying

Do not categorize. Follow the source location. 

So your categories are just overlays.

In case of category is new write here, until solid category arises.

## Leaf

Write single leaf name as if it can be folder name.

So later make it folder with root file and other files.

## What if overlay has nonsensical symbols in path?

Retain it.

## What if underlying disappears or rebuilds its navigation?

I do not see problem with that.
