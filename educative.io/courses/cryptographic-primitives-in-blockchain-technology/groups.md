# Binary opeator

It tells about `binary operators`.

Let `*` - to be binary operator.

`*: G x G -> G` <- tells that binary operator combines 2 elements from G set to one element from G.

Set can be `closed` under binary operator , if operator applied to set produces element from same set.


# Group (G,*)

Is set `G` with `*` is called `group` if it is `closed`, `associative`(with `identity` and `inverse`).

## Abelian

If `commutative``


## Group Hylomorphism

G, *
H, x

mapping f : G -> H if 

$$
f(x * y) = f(x) \cdot f(y)
$$


if $e_G$ then $ \phi(e_H) = e_H $

if $ a^{-1} in G  => \phi(a^{-1}) = \phi(a)^{-1} $  in H
