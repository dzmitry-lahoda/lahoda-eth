Derivative requires two parties agree on future transaction.

Parties either agree bilateraly, or after agreement transaction are enforced by 3rd party clearing house.

Restructuring allow to compress underlying principal with retaining same position semantically.

Underlying principal is value controlled by position,
while transaction value is less.

## Forward contract:

- has one long party and one short party.
- is obligation for both parties
 
Neutralizes risk by fixing price.

Long is agreed to buy, and long agreed to sell.

Future contract is standard forward.

If more investors want to go long price up, if go short price is down.
