Optimization is cost minimization or reward maximization.

Cost minimization = - Reward maximization

Decision variable $x \isin R^n$

Cost function $f: R^n \rightarrow R$


Constrains on decision variables are Equality and Inequality.

Equality are h_i(x) = 0, i=1,...

Inequality g_j(x) <= 0, j=1,... 

Form feasible set for x


If f, h, g are linear than problem is Linear Program(problem)
